# Introduction

WELCOME TO PUZZLEBOT! BEFORE YOU START MAKING ROBOTICS, YOU’LL NEED TO KNOW SOME BASIC FUNCTIONALITIES OF THE ROBOT.

* Puzzlebot by Manchester Robotics is a platform for robotics and control systems development and education.

* Unlike other products, Puzzlebot has sufficient processing capacity to handle multiple advanced add-on components (e.g. different actuators and sensors such as sonar LiDAR, and line following sensors).

* Allows customers to use a consistent platform for their entire robotics learning journey from starter kit tutorials all the way to professional prototyping.

* The “brain” of Puzzlebot is the Hackerboard. The board acts as a robust computational node for Starter Kit components (e.g. motors) and a communication interface to external computing units (laptops, phones, NVIDIA Jetson Nano, etc.).

   
## General Information
  * The Puzzlebot Starter Kit contains all the essential components needed to quickly access meaningful robotics capabilities (i.e. a programmable, roaming robot)and       provides a user-friendly platform for incorporating a wide range of advanced add-on feature sets.
