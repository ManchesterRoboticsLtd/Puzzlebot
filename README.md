# Introduction

* Puzzlebot by Manchester Robotics is a platform for robotics and control systems development and education.

* Puzzlebot is a universal tool for robotics, to help others learn, create, and innovate their own robotic projects. 

* The governing philosophy is that customers are motivated to learn robotics by the appeal of advanced features, which therefore offer far more value than over-simplified proxies with high cost, and limited utility

* The Puzzlebot is a cross-platform, open-source, plug-and play mobile robot. 
  - Programed in different languages, catering to learner’s preferred starting languages.
  - Capable of accommodating 3rd party off-the-shelf components.
  
* The Puzzlebot was born as an answer to the concept of robotic democratization.
  - Keeping unit costs low and education available to everyone, thereby democratising access.
  
* Provides continuity from entry-level access to research-level functionality ensuring learners to focus on progressing skills rather than having to constantly switch between robotics platforms.

* The “brain” of Puzzlebot is the Hackerboard. The board acts as a robust computational node for Starter Kit components (e.g. motors) and a communication interface to external computing units (laptops, phones, NVIDIA Jetson Nano, etc.).

  * The Puzzlebot Kits contain all the neccessary components needed to quickly access meaningful robotics capabilities (i.e. a programmable, roaming robot)and       provides a user-friendly platform for incorporating a wide range of advanced add-on feature sets.
  * The Puzzlebot, is configured into four different types (Editions/Kits).
  * Each kit has different capabilities and configurations, according to the user needs.
  * The basic kit is called *Hacker Kit* the rest of the kits "grow" in complexity, always keeping *Hacker Kit* as a base.

## Puzzlebot Learning Kits
  ### Puzzlebot Hacker Edition
  - The Puzzlebot Hacker Edition contains all the essential components needed to quickly access meaningful robotics capabilities and provides a user-friendly platform for incorporating a wide range of advanced add-on feature-sets.
    
  ### Puzzlebot Laser Edition
  - The Puzzlebot Laser Edition is an extension of the *Puzzlebot Hacker Edition* which encompasses the VL53L1X TOF (Time Of Flight) Laser Sensor and a 9g Servo Motor to provide of more autonomous capabilities such as obstacle avoidance, 2D mapping, etc.
    
  ### Puzzlebot NVIDIA Jetson Edition
  - The Puzzlebot NVIDIA JETSON® Edition is an extension of the Puzzlebot Hacker Edition encompassing an NVIDIA Jetson® CPU, and a Raspberry Pi® Camera . Combining 
the power of the Hacker Board and the NVIDIA JETSON Nano®, allows users to implement research-level, real-time algorithms such as AI & Computer Vision, SLAM and autonomous driving algorithms using ROS.

  ### Puzzlebot NVIDIA Jetson LiDAR Edition
  - The Puzzlebot NVIDIA JETSON® - Lidar Edition is another extension of the Puzzlebot Hacker Edition encompassing an NVIDIA Jetson® CPU, a Raspberry Pi® Camera and a LIDAR . This combination allows allows users to implement research-level, real-time algorithms such as AI & Computer Vision, obstacle avoidance and SLAM and autonomous driving algorithms using ROS.
